# CS537 Fall 2024 - Project 1 - Letter Boxed

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
The goal of this project was to implement a **Letter Boxed solution validator** in C. Given a board configuration and a dictionary file, the program checks whether a sequence of words follows the game's rules, ensuring that:  
- All letters on the board are used at least once.  
- Consecutive words connect by first and last letter.  
- Letters on the same side are not used consecutively.  
- Words appear in the provided dictionary.\
**These are the same rules as found on the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed)**\
This project tested my ability to work with **file I/O, string processing, and dynamic memory management** in a structured C program.

## 🎯 What I Learned  
This assignment helped me refine my **C programming** skills and reinforced several key concepts:  
✅ **File Handling in C** – Reading and parsing structured input files efficiently.  
✅ **String Processing** – Validating words and enforcing game rules using string manipulation.  
✅ **Dynamic Memory Management** – Handling unknown input sizes using `malloc()` and `free()`.  
✅ **Error Handling & Debugging** – Implementing robust error checks for edge cases.  
✅ **Algorithm Design** – Optimizing lookups for dictionary validation and board state tracking.
